During the Covid-19 pandemic I developed an interest in magic. The show kind of magic.

Naturally I became especially interested in combining magic and programming.

What I noticed was that most magic apps are only available on iOS. I asked Marc Kerstein, a well known app magician and programmer, about that.

**TL,DR:**

* He only has personal capacity to develop on iOS
* Android has a piracy problem
* Due to the small amount of potential users the apps are expensive. iOS users are known to spend more on apps than their Android counterparts

He pointed me towards this post of his on Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Magic/comments/fqj99c/new_app_amalgam_by_marc_kerstein/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Magic/comments/fqj99c/new_app_amalgam_by_marc_kerstein/).
